# Cover Me
Cover-me is a web application which generates a customized job cover letter (or application email) based on the job description.  

The web app comes with a minimal design and fetches reponses from the OpenAI API to generate cover letters.  

The user needs to enter their API keys once and the web app remembers it for future use, with an option to change the key whenever needed.
